# Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease

This was a project on early detection of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, which is difficult and sometimes impossible when relying on conventional means such as MRI or CT scans.

Recent studies show that handwriting data is an effective diagnostic tool. To this end, I used a public dataset, NewHandPD, that has been published.

Using this dataset, I employed 3 different deep learning approaches and compared them based on accuracy. Subsequently, I used the best performing model to classify patients as healthy and unhealthy.
